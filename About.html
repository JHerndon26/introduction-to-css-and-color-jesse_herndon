    My favorite Hobby
</h2>

<div class="w3-gray">
<p>
    One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. I grew up cooking in the kitchen with my mom and have always had a passion for food.
    I like the process of making things with my hands and being creative with what I serve people. One of my favorite things to
    make is chicken tacos with chipotle peppers.
